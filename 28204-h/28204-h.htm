<h2>EXPLANATION OF MAP</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> top of the map is South. This is
always so with the Hollow Tree People.
The cross on the shelf below the edge of the
world (where the ladder is) is where Mr.
Dog landed, and the ladder is the one brought
by Mr. Man for him to climb back on. The
tree that Mr. Man cut down shows too.
The spot on the edge of the world is where
the Hollow Tree People sometimes sit and
hang their feet over, and talk. A good many
paths show, but not all by a good deal.
The bridge and plank near Mr. Turtle's house
lead to the Wide Grass Lands and Big West
Hills. The spots along the Foot Race show
where Grandpaw Hare stopped, and the one
across the fence shows where Mr. Turtle
landed. Most of the other things tell what
they are, and all the things are a good deal
farther apart than they look. Of course
there was not room on the map for everything.</p>

<h2>MR. DOG PLAYS SANTA<br />
CLAUS</h2>

<h3>A STORY TOLD WHEN IT WAS SNOWING OUTSIDE,
AND THE LITTLE LADY WAS WONDERING
HOW IT WAS IN THE FAR DEEP WOODS</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time, said the Story Teller,
the Robin, and Turtle, and Squirrel, and
Jack Rabbit had all gone home for the winter,
and nobody was left in the Hollow Tree
except the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old
Black Crow. Of course the others used to
come back and visit them pretty often, and
Mr. Dog, too, now that he had got to be
good friends with all the Deep Woods People,
and they thought a great deal of him when
they got to know him better. Mr. Dog told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
them a lot of things they had never heard
of before, things that he'd learned at Mr.
Man's house, and maybe that's one reason
why they got to liking him so well.</div>

<p>He told them about Santa Claus, for one
thing, and how the old fellow came down
the chimney on Christmas Eve to bring
presents to Mr. Man and his children, who
always hung up their stockings for them,
and Mr. Dog said that once he had hung
up his stocking, too, and got a nice bone in
it, that was so good he had buried and dug
it up again as much as six times before
spring. He said that Santa Claus always
came to Mr. Man's house, and that whenever
the children hung up their stockings
they were always sure to get something in
them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="308" height="400" alt="HE TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT SANTA CLAUS" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT SANTA CLAUS</span>
</div>

<p>Well, the Hollow Tree people had never
heard of Santa Claus. They knew about
Christmas, of course, because everybody,
even the cows and sheep, know about that;
but they had never heard of Santa Claus.
You see, Santa Claus only comes to Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Man's house, but they didn't know that,
either, so they thought if they just hung
up their stockings he'd come there, too, and
that's what they made up their minds to do.
They talked about it a great deal together,
and Mr. 'Possum looked over all his stockings
to pick out the biggest one he had,
and Mr. Crow made himself a new pair on
purpose. Mr. 'Coon said he never knew Mr.
Crow to make himself such big stockings
before, but Mr. Crow said he was getting old
and needed things bigger, and when he loaned
one of his new stockings to Mr. 'Coon, Mr.
'Coon said, "That's so," and that he guessed
they were about right after all. They didn't
tell anybody about it at first, but by and
by they told Mr. Dog what they were going
to do, and when Mr. Dog heard it he wanted
to laugh right out. You see, he knew Santa
Claus never went anywhere except to Mr.
Man's house, and he thought it would be
a great joke on the Hollow Tree people when
they hung up their stockings and didn't get
anything.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="267" height="400" alt="MR. CROW MADE HIMSELF A NEW PAIR ON PURPOSE" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. CROW MADE HIMSELF A NEW PAIR ON PURPOSE</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>But by and by Mr. Dog thought about
something else. He thought it would be
too bad for them to be disappointed that
way. You see, Mr. Dog liked them all, now,
and when he had thought about that a minute
he made up his mind to do something.
And this is what it was&mdash;he made up his
mind to play Santa Claus!</p>

<p>He knew just how Santa Claus looked,
'cause he'd seen lots of his pictures at Mr.
Man's house, and he thought it would be
great fun to dress up that way and take a
bag of presents to the Hollow Tree while they
were all asleep and fill up the stockings of
the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black
Crow. But first he had to be sure of some
way of getting in, so he said to them he
didn't see how they could expect Santa Claus,
their chimneys were so small, and Mr. Crow
said they could leave their latch string out
down stairs, which was just what Mr. Dog
wanted. Then they said they were going
to have all the folks that had spent the summer
with them over for Christmas dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and to see the presents they had got in
their stockings. They told Mr. Dog to
drop over, too, if he could get away, and
Mr. Dog said he would, and went off laughing
to himself and ran all the way home
because he felt so pleased at what he was
going to do.</p>

<p>Well, he had to work pretty hard, I tell
you, to get things ready. It wasn't so hard
to get the presents as it was to rig up his
Santa Claus dress. He found some long
wool out in Mr. Man's barn for his white
whiskers, and he put some that wasn't so
long on the edges of his overcoat and boot
tops and around an old hat he had. Then
he borrowed a big sack he found out there,
too, and fixed it up to swing over his back,
just as he had seen Santa Claus do in the
pictures. He had a lot of nice things to take
along. Three tender young chickens he'd
borrowed from Mr. Man, for one thing, and
then he bought some new neckties for the
Hollow Tree folks all around, and a big,
striped candy cane for each one, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
candy canes always looked well sticking out
of a stocking. Besides all that, he had a new
pipe for each, and a package of tobacco.
You see, Mr. Dog lived with Mr. Man, and
didn't ever have to buy much for himself,
so he had always saved his money. He
had even more things than that, but I
can't remember just now what they were;
and when he started out, all dressed up
like Santa Claus, I tell you his bag was
pretty heavy, and he almost wished before
he got there that he hadn't started with
quite so much.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i005a.jpg" width="280" height="400" alt="IT GOT HEAVIER AND HEAVIER" title="" />
<span class="caption">IT GOT HEAVIER AND HEAVIER</span>
</div>

<p>It got heavier and heavier all the way, and
he was glad enough to get there and find
the latch string out. He set his bag down
to rest a minute before climbing the stairs,
and then opened the doors softly and listened.
He didn't hear a thing except Mr. Crow
and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum breathing
pretty low, and he knew they might wake
up any minute, and he wouldn't have been
caught there in the midst of things for a
good deal. So he slipped up just as easy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as anything, and when he got up in the big
parlor room he almost had to laugh right
out loud, for there were the stockings sure
enough, all hung up in a row, and a card
with a name on it over each one telling who
it belonged to.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i005b.jpg" width="292" height="400" alt="HE ALMOST HAD TO LAUGH RIGHT OUT LOUD" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE ALMOST HAD TO LAUGH RIGHT OUT LOUD</span>
</div>

<p>Then he listened again, and all at once
he jumped and held his breath, for he heard
Mr. 'Possum say something. But Mr. 'Possum
was only talking in his sleep, and saying,
"I'll take another piece, please," and
Mr. Dog knew he was dreaming about the
mince pie he'd had for supper.</p>

<p>So then he opened his bag and filled the
stockings. He put in mixed candy and nuts
and little things first, and then the pipes
and tobacco and candy canes, so they'd
show at the top, and hung a nice dressed
chicken outside. I tell you, they looked
fine! It almost made Mr. Dog wish he had
a stocking of his own there to fill, and he
forgot all about them waking up, and sat
down in a chair to look at the stockings.
It was a nice rocking chair, and over in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
dark corner where they wouldn't be apt to
see him, even if one of them did wake up
and stick his head out of his room, so Mr.
Dog felt pretty safe now, anyway. He
rocked softly, and looked and looked at the
nice stockings, and thought how pleased
they'd be in the morning, and how tired he
was. You've heard about people being as
tired as a dog; and that's just how Mr.
Dog felt. He was so tired he didn't feel a
bit like starting home, and by and by&mdash;he
never did know how it happened&mdash;but by
and by Mr. Dog went sound asleep right
there in his chair, with all his Santa Claus
clothes on.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 290px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="290" height="400" alt="TO SEE MR. DOG JUMP RIGHT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF HIS CHAIR" title="" />
<span class="caption">TO SEE MR. DOG JUMP RIGHT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF HIS CHAIR</span>
</div>

<p>And there he sat, with his empty bag in
his hand and the nice full stockings in front
of him, all night long. Even when it came
morning and began to get light Mr. Dog
didn't know it; he just slept right on, he
was that tired. Then pretty soon the door
of Mr. 'Possum's room opened and he poked
out his head. And just then the door of
Mr. 'Coon's room opened and he poked out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>his</i> head. Then the door of the Old Black
Crow opened and out poked <i>his</i> head. They
all looked toward the stockings, and they
didn't see Mr. Dog, or even each other, at
all. They saw their stockings, though, and
Mr. 'Coon said all at once:&mdash;</p>


<p>"Oh, there's something in my stocking!"</p>

<p>And then Mr. Crow said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, there's something in my stocking,
too!"</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Possum said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, there's something in all our stockings!"</p>

<p>And with that they gave a great hurrah
all together, and rushed out and grabbed
their stockings and turned around just in
time to see Mr. Dog jump right straight up
out of his chair, for he did not know where
he was the least bit in the world.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's Santa Claus himself!" they
all shouted together, and made a rush for
their rooms, for they were scared almost to
death. Then it all dawned on Mr. Dog in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
second, and he commenced to laugh and
hurrah to think what a joke it was on everybody.
And when they heard Mr. Dog laugh
they knew him right away, and they all
came up and looked at him, and he had to
tell just what he'd done and everything;
so they emptied out their stockings on the
floor and ate some of the presents and looked
at the others, until they almost forgot about
breakfast, just as children do on Christmas
morning.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Crow said, all at once, that he'd
make a little coffee, and that Mr. Dog must
stay and have some, and by and by they
made him promise to spend the day with
them and be there when the Robin and the
Squirrel and Mr. Turtle and Jack Rabbit
came, which he did.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="500" height="240" alt="IT WAS SNOWING HARD OUTSIDE, WHICH MADE IT A NICER CHRISTMAS THAN IF IT HADN&#39;T BEEN" title="" />
<span class="caption">IT WAS SNOWING HARD OUTSIDE, WHICH MADE IT A NICER CHRISTMAS THAN IF IT HADN&#39;T BEEN</span>
</div>

<p>And it was snowing hard outside, which
made it a nicer Christmas than if it hadn't
been, and when all the others came they
brought presents, too. And when they saw
Mr. Dog dressed up as Santa Claus and
heard how he'd gone to sleep and been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
caught, they laughed and laughed. And it
snowed so hard that Mr. Dog had to stay
for dinner, which he wanted to do more than
anything, because he knew that then they
would all sit around and tell stories.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>MR. DOG AT THE CIRCUS</h2>

<h3>THE HOLLOW TREE PEOPLE LEARN SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT SHOWS</h3>


<div class='cap'>THAT was a great Christmas in the Hollow
Tree. The 'Coon and the 'Possum and
the Old Black Crow had been getting ready
for it for a long time, and brought in ever
so many nice things to eat, which Mr. Crow
had cooked for them, for Mr. Crow is the
best cook of anybody in the Big Deep Woods.
Then Mr. Dog had brought a lot of good
things, too, which he had borrowed from
Mr. Man's house, so they had the finest
Christmas dinner that you can think of, and
plenty for the next day, when it would be
even better, because chicken and turkey
and dressing and such things are always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
better the next day, and even the <i>third</i> day,
with gravy, than they are when they are
first cooked.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="THE PANTRY IN THE HOLLOW TREE" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE PANTRY IN THE HOLLOW TREE</span>
</div>

<p>Then, when they were all through and
were standing around, smoking their new
pipes and looking at each other's new neckties
and other Christmas things, Mr. Crow
said that he and Mr. Squirrel would clear
off the table if the others would get in some
wood and stir up the fire and set the room
to rights, so they could gather round and be
comfortable by and by; and then, he said
it might snow as much as it liked as long as
they had plenty of wood and things to eat
inside.</p>

<p>So then they all skurried around getting
on their things to go out after wood&mdash;all except
Mr. Crow and Mr. Squirrel, who set
about clearing off the table and doing up the
dishes. And pretty soon Mr. Dog and Mr.
'Coon and the rest were hopping about
where the snow was falling so soft and silent
among the big, leafless trees, gathering nice
pieces of wood and brushing the snow off of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
them and piling them into the first down
stairs of the Hollow Tree, which the 'Coon
and 'Possum and Old Black Crow use for
their wood house and general store room. It
was great fun, and they didn't feel the least
bit cold after their warm dinner and with
all that brisk exercise.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="MR. ROBIN HOPPED ABOUT AND LOOKED FOR GOOD PIECES" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. ROBIN HOPPED ABOUT AND LOOKED FOR GOOD PIECES</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Robin didn't help carry the wood in.
He was hardly strong enough for that, but
he hopped about and looked for good pieces,
and when he found one he would call to Mr.
'Coon or Mr. 'Possum, or maybe to one of
the others, to throw it on his shoulder and
carry it in, and then he would tell whoever
it happened to be how strong he was and
how fine he looked with that great chunk
on his shoulder, and would say that he
didn't suppose there was another 'Coon, or
'Possum, or Turtle, or Rabbit, or Dog that
could begin to stand up straight under such
a chunk as that anywhere outside of a
menagerie. Mr. Robin likes to say pleasant
things to his friends, and is always popular.
And each one tried to carry the biggest load<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of wood to show how strong he was, and
pretty soon they had the lower room of the
Hollow Tree piled up high with the finest
chunks and kindling pieces to be found
anywhere. Then they all hurried up stairs,
stamping the snow off their feet, and
gathered around the nice warm fire in the
big parlor which was just below the three
big hollow branches where the 'Coon and
'Possum and the Old Black Crow had their
rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow and Mr. Squirrel were through
with the table by this time, and all hands lit
their pipes, and looked into the fire, and
smoked, and rested, and thought a little
before they began talking&mdash;thinking, of
course, of what a good time they were having,
and how comfortable and nice it was to
be inside and warm when such a big snow
was falling outside.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum was the first one to say anything.
He said he had been thinking of
what Mr. Robin had said about them being
outside of a menagerie, and that, come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
think about it, he believed he didn't know
what a menagerie was, unless it was a new
name for a big dinner, as that was the only
thing he could think of now that they were
outside of, and he said if that was so, and
if he could get outside of two menageries,
he thought he could carry in a bigger
chunk than any two chunks there were
down stairs.</p>

<p>Then all the others laughed a good deal,
and Mr. 'Coon said he had thought that
perhaps a menagerie was something to wear
that would make anybody who had it on
very strong, and able to stand up under a
big load, and to eat as much as Mr. 'Possum
could, or even more.</p>

<p>But Mr. Robin said that it didn't mean
either of those things. He said he didn't
really know what it did mean himself, but
that it must be some kind of a place that
had a great many large creatures in it, for
he had quite often heard his grandmother
call his grandfather the biggest goose outside
of a menagerie, though, being very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
young then, Mr. Robin couldn't remember
just what she had meant by it.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit said he thought that the word
"menagerie" sounded like some kind of a
picnic, with swings and nice lively games,
and Mr. Crow said that once when he was
flying he passed over a place where there
was a big sign that said "Menagerie" on
it, and that there were some tents and a
crowd of people and a great noise, but that
he hadn't seen anything that he could carry
off without being noticed, so he didn't stop.</p>

<p>Mr. Squirrel thought that from what Mr.
Crow said it must be a place where there
would be a lot of fine things to see, and Mr.
Turtle said that he was a good deal over
three hundred years old and had often heard
of a menagerie, but that he had never seen
one. He said he had always supposed that
it was a nice pond of clear water, with a lot
of happy turtles and fish and wild geese and
ducks and such things, in it, and maybe
some animals around it, all living happily
together, and taken care of by Mr. Man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
who brought them a great many good things
to eat. He had always thought he would like
to live in a menagerie, he said, but that nobody
had ever invited him, and he had
never happened to come across one in his
travels.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog hadn't been saying anything all
this time, but he knocked the ashes out of
his pipe now, and filled it up fresh and lit
it, and cleared his throat, and began to
talk. It made him smile, he said, to hear
the different ways people thought of a thing
they had never seen. He said that Mr.
Turtle was the only one who came anywhere
near to what a menagerie really was,
though of course Mr. Crow <i>had</i> seen one on
the outside. Then Mr. Dog said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="285" height="400" alt="SLIPPED IN BEHIND HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO THE TENT" title="" />
<span class="caption">SLIPPED IN BEHIND HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO THE TENT</span>
</div>

<p>"I know all about menageries, on the
outside and the inside too, for I have been
to one. I went once with Mr. Man, though
I wasn't really invited to go. In fact, Mr.
Man invited me to stay at home, and tried
to slip off from me; but I watched which
way he went, and took long roundin's on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
him, and slipped in behind him when he
went into the tent. He didn't know for a
while that I was there, and I wasn't there
so very long. But it was plenty long enough&mdash;a
good deal longer than I'd ever stay
again, unless I was tied.</p>

<p>"I never saw so many wild, fierce-looking
creatures in my life as there were in that
menagerie, and they were just as wild and
fierce as they looked. They had a lot of
cages full of them and they had some outside
of cages, though I don't know why they
should leave any of those dangerous animals
around where they could damage folks that
happened to come in reach, as I did. Those
animals outside didn't look as wild and fierce
as those in the cages, but they were.</p>

<p>"I kept in the crowd, close behind Mr.
Man at first, and nobody knew I was there,
but by and by he climbed up into a seat to
watch some people all dressed up in fancy
clothes ride around a ring on horses, which
I didn't care much about, so I slipped away,
and went over to where there were some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
things that I wanted to take my time to and
see quietly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="417" height="400" alt="&quot;HE LOOKED SMILING AND GOOD-NATURED, AND I WENT OVER TO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE LOOKED SMILING AND GOOD-NATURED, AND I WENT OVER TO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"There was an animal about my size and
style tied over in one corner of the tent,
behind a rope, with a sign in front of him
which said, 'The Only Tame Hyena in the
World,' He looked smiling and good-natured,
and I went over to ask him some
questions.</p>

<p>"But that sign wasn't true. He wasn't
the least bit tame, and I'm sure now that
he wasn't smiling. He grabbed me before
I had a chance to say a word, and when I
jerked loose, which I did right away, for I
didn't want to stir up any fuss there, I left
quite a piece of my ear with the tame hyena,
and tripped backward over the rope and
rolled right in front of a creature called an
elephant, about as big as a house and not as
useful.</p>

<p>"I suppose they thought <i>he</i> was tame, too,
but he must have been tamed by the same
man, for he grabbed me with a kind of a
tail that grew on the end of his nose&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thing a good deal like Mr. 'Possum's tail,
only about a million times as big&mdash;and I
could hear my ribs crack as he waved me up
and down.</p>

<p>"Of course, as I say, I didn't want to stir
up any fuss, but I couldn't keep still under
such treatment as that, and I called right
out to Mr. Man, where he sat looking at the
fancy people riding, and told him that I had
had enough of the show, and if he wanted
to take any of me home he ought not to
wait very long, but come over that way and
see if he couldn't get the tame elephant to
practise that performance on the hyena or
the next dog, because I had had plenty, and
was willing to go home just as I was, all
in one piece, even if not very lively.</p>

<p>"Mr. Man <i>came</i>, too, and so did a lot of
the others. They seemed to think that I
was more to look at than those riding people;
and some of them laughed, though
what there was happening that was funny
I have never been able to guess to this day.
I kept right on telling Mr. Man what I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wanted him to do, and mebbe I made a good
deal of noise about it, for it seemed to stir
up those other animals. There was a cage
full of lions that started the most awful roaring
you can think of, and a cage of crazy-looking
things they called monkeys that
screeched and howled and swung back and
forth in rings and held on to the bars, and
all the other things joined in, until I couldn't
tell whether I was still saying anything or
not. I suppose they were all jealous of the
elephant because of the fun he was having,
and howling to be let out so they could get
hold of me too.</p>

<p>"Well, you never heard of such a time.
It nearly broke up the show. Everybody
ran over to look, and even the riding people
stopped their horses to enjoy it, too. If it
only hadn't been so dangerous and unpleasant
I should have been proud of the way
they came to see me perform.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Man didn't seem to like it
much. I heard him tell somebody, as loud
as he could, that I would be killed, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I was the best dog he ever had, and that if
I <i>was</i> killed he'd sue the show.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="331" height="425" alt="&quot;GAVE ME AN EXTRA BIG SWING AND CRACK&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;GAVE ME AN EXTRA BIG SWING AND CRACK&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That made me proud, too, but I wished
he wouldn't wait to sue the show, but would
do something right away, and just then a
man with a fancy dress on and a stick with
a sharp iron hook on it came running up
and said something I didn't understand and
hit the elephant with the hook end of the
stick, and he gave me an extra big swing and
crack and flung me half way across the tent,
where I landed on a bunch of hay right in
front of a long-necked thing called a camel&mdash;another
terrible tame creature, I suppose&mdash;who
had me about half eaten up with his
old long under lip before Mr. Man could
get over there.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Man did get hold of me, he
said that I'd better take what was left of me
home, for they were going to feed the animals
pretty soon, and that I would likely
get mixed up with the bill of fare.</p>

<p>"After that he took me to the entrance
and pushed me outside, and I heard all those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
fierce creatures in the cages growl and roar
louder than ever, as if they had expected to
sample me and were sorry to see me go.</p>

<p>"That's what a menagerie is&mdash;it's a place
where they have all the kinds of animals
and things in the world, for show, and a good
many birds, and maybe turtles, too, but
they don't have any fine clear pond. They
have just a big tent, like the one Mr. Crow
saw, and a lot of cages inside. They keep
most of the animals in cages, and they ought
to keep them all there, and I don't think
they feed them very much, nor the best
things, or they wouldn't look so fierce and
hungry.</p>

<p>"They just keep them for Mr. Man and
his friends to look at and talk about, and if
Mr. Turtle will take my advice he will keep
out of a menagerie and live in the Wide
Blue Water where he was born. I wouldn't
have gone there again unless I had been
dragged there by force, or unless they had
put those tame animals into cages with the
others. No doubt there are some very fine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
strong animals in a menagerie, but they
wouldn't be there if they could help it, and
if anybody ever invites any of you to join
a menagerie, take my advice and don't do
it."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Dog knocked the ashes out of
his pipe again, and all the other Deep Woods
People knocked the ashes out of <i>their</i> pipes,
too, and filled them up fresh, and one said
one thing, and one said another about being
in a menagerie or out of it, and every one
thought it would be a terrible thing to be
shut up in a cage, except Mr. 'Possum, who
said he wouldn't mind it if they would let
him sleep enough and give him all he could
eat, but that a cage without those things
would be a lonesome place.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon said that a little adventure
had happened to him once which he had
never mentioned before, because he had
never known just what to make of it; but
he knew now, he said, that he had come
very near getting into a menagerie, and he
would tell them just what happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The Story Teller looked down at the quiet
figure in his lap. The Little Lady's head
was nestled close to his shoulder, and her
eyes were straining very hard to keep open.</p>

<p>I think we will save Mr. 'Coon's story till
another night, he said.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2>WHEN MR. 'COON WAS A<br />LITTLE BOY</h2>

<h3>MR. 'COON TELLS HOW HE CAME NEAR BEING
A PART OF A MENAGERIE, AND HOW HE
ONCE TOLD A STORY TO MR. DOG</h3>


<div class='cap'>"YOU can tell about Mr. 'Coon, now&mdash;the
the story you didn't tell last night,
you know," and the Little Lady wriggles
herself into a comfortable corner just below
the Story Teller's smoke, and looks deep into
a great cavern of glowing embers between
the big old andirons, where, in her fancy,
she can picture the Hollow Tree people and
their friends.</div>

<p>Why, yes, let me see&mdash;says the Story
Teller.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dog had just told about being at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the menagerie, you know, and Mr. 'Coon
was just going to tell how he came very
near getting into a menagerie himself."</p>

<p>Oh, yes, of course&mdash;well, then, all the
Hollow Tree people, the 'Coon and 'Possum
and the Old Black Crow, and their friends
who were visiting them&mdash;Mr. Dog and Mr.
Robin and Jack Rabbit and Mr. Turtle and
Mr. Squirrel&mdash;knocked the ashes out of their
pipes and filled them up fresh&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, they had just done that."</p>

<p>That's so, I forgot. Well, anyway, as
soon as they got to smoking and settled
back around the fire again Mr. 'Coon told
them his story, and I guess we'll call it</p>


<h3><br />MR. 'COON'S EARLY ADVENTURE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="367" height="400" alt="ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD A FIERCE BARK CLOSE BEHIND HIM" title="" />
<span class="caption">ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD A FIERCE BARK CLOSE BEHIND HIM</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. 'Coon said he was quite young when
it happened, and was taking a pleasant
walk one evening, to think over things a
little, and perhaps to pick out a handy tree
where Mr. Man's chickens roosted, when all
at once he heard a fierce bark close behind
him, and he barely had time to get up a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tree himself when a strange and very noisy
Mr. Dog was leaping about at the foot of the
tree, making a great fuss, and calling every
moment for Mr. Man to hurry, for he had
a young 'coon treed.</p>

<p>"Of course I laid pretty low when I heard
that," Mr. 'Coon said, "for I knew that
Mr. Man would most likely have a gun, so
I got into a bunch of leaves and brush that
must have been some kind of an old nest,
and scrooched down so that none of me
would show.</p>

<p>"Then by and by I heard some big
creature come running through the brush,
and I peeked over a little, and there, sure
enough, was Mr. Man with a long gun, and
I noticed that he wore a thing on his head&mdash;a
sort of hat, I suppose&mdash;made of what
looked to be the skin of some relative of
mine.</p>

<p>"Of course that made me mad. I hadn't
cared so much until I saw that; but I said
right then to myself that any one who would
do such a thing as that never could be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
friend of mine, no matter how much he
tried. So I scrooched down and laid low
in that old nest, and didn't move or let on
in any way that I was there.</p>

<p>"Then I heard Mr. Man walking around
the tree and talking to his dog and telling
him that there wasn't anything up in that
tree at all, and that Mr. Dog had just been
fooling him. I could tell by his voice that
he was getting mad at Mr. Dog, and I hoped
that he'd get mad enough pretty soon to take
a stick to him for chasing me up a tree like
that, calling all the time for Mr. Man to
come and see me when there wasn't really
anything to look at.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Dog kept galloping around the
tree and barking out, over and over, that
I was there; that he had seen me, and that
he knew that I was hiding up there somewhere;
and pretty soon I heard Mr. Man
going away, and I peeked over again.</p>

<p>"Sure enough, he was going, but Mr.
Dog was staying right there, sitting under
the tree and looking up and making a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
deal more noise than there was any need
of to let me know he hadn't gone. I didn't
see why he stayed there. I wished he'd go
away and 'tend to his own business.</p>

<p>"Being quite young, I still lived with my
folks over near the Wide Grass Lands, and
I wanted to get home for supper. It was
a good way to go, for the tree I had climbed
was over close to the edge of the world where
the sun and moon rise, and you all know
that's a good way, even from here.</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't go, but just sat there,
barking up that tree, and after a long time
I heard somebody coming again, and I
peeked over, and there was Mr. Man, hurrying
back, this time with an axe. I knew,
right then, there was going to be trouble.
I knew they were going to cut that tree
down, and that I should most likely have
quite a fuss with Mr. Dog, and perhaps go
home with a black eye and a scratched nose,
and then get whipped again for fighting,
after I got there."</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon stopped and knocked the ashes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
out of his pipe and filled it up fresh, and all
the others knocked the ashes out of their
pipes and filled them up fresh, too. Then
Mr. 'Possum poked up the fire and told Mr.
Turtle to bring a stick of wood from down
stairs, and when it was blazing up high
and bright again they all stepped over to
the window a minute, to see how hard it
was snowing and banking up outside, then
went back to their chairs around the fire,
and stretched out their feet and leaned back
and smoked, and listened to the rest of Mr.
'Coon's story.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon said he didn't like the sound
of that axe when Mr. Man began to cut
the tree down.</p>

<p>"Every time he struck the tree I could
feel it all through me," he said, "and I
knew if he kept that noise up long enough
it would give me a nervous headache. I
wished the tree would hurry up and drop,
so we could have what muss we were going
to, and get it over with. I'd have got out
of that old nest and made a jump for another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
tree if there had been any near enough,
but there wasn't, so I just laid low and gritted
my teeth and let him chop.</p>

<p>"Well, by and by the tree began to go
down. It seemed to teeter a little at first,
this way and that; then it went very slow
in one direction; then it went a little faster;
then it went a good deal faster; then I
suddenly felt like a shooting-star, I came
down so fast, and there was a big crash, and
I thought I had turned into a lot of stars,
sure enough, and was shooting in every direction,
and the next I knew I was tied to a
tree hand and foot and around the middle,
and Mr. Man and Mr. Dog were sitting
and looking at me, and grinning, and talking
about what they were going to do.</p>

<p>"Mr. Man wasn't scolding Mr. Dog any
more. He was telling him what a good
thing it was they had caught me alive,
for now they could sell me to a show and
get a great deal more for me than they
could for my skin. I didn't know what a
show was, then, or about menageries, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I know now, and I can see just what they
meant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="323" height="425" alt="&quot;THEN I SUDDENLY FELT LIKE A SHOOTING-STAR&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THEN I SUDDENLY FELT LIKE A SHOOTING-STAR&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Pretty soon Mr. Man told Mr. Dog to
stay there and watch me while he went
home after a box to put me in. He said
he didn't think it would be safe to carry me
in his arms, and he was right about that.</p>

<p>"So then Mr. Man walked off, and left
Mr. Dog guarding me and saying unpleasant
things to me now and then.</p>

<p>"At first I wouldn't answer him; but
pretty soon I happened to think of something
pleasant to say.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Dog,' I said, 'I know a good story,
if you'd like me to tell it. Mr. Man may
be a good while getting that box, and mebbe
you'd like to hear something to pass the
time.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Dog said he would. He said that
Mr. Man would most likely have to make
the box, and he didn't suppose he knew where
the hammer and nails were, and it might
be dark before Mr. Man got back.</p>

<p>"I felt a good deal better when I heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Mr. Dog say that, and I told him a story
I knew about how Mr. Rabbit lost his tail,
and Mr. Dog laughed and seemed to like it,
and said, 'Tell me another.'"</p>

<p>Before Mr. 'Coon could go on with his
story, Mr. Rabbit said that of course if that
old tale had helped Mr. 'Coon out of trouble
he was very glad, but that it wasn't at all
true, and that some time <i>he</i> would tell them
himself the true story of how it happened.</p>

<p>Then they all said that they hoped he
would, for they'd always wanted to hear
that story told right, and then Mr. 'Coon
went on with his adventure.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="352" height="450" alt="THEN MR. DOG SAID, &quot;TELL ME ANOTHER&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">THEN MR. DOG SAID, &quot;TELL ME ANOTHER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. 'Coon said that when Mr. Dog said,
"Tell me another," he knew he was in a
good humor, and that he felt better and
better himself. "I thought, if Mr. Man
didn't come back too soon," he said, "I
might get along pretty well with Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"'I know another story, Mr. Dog,' I said&mdash;'the
funniest story there is. It would
make you laugh until you fell over the edge
of the world, but I can't tell it here.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Why,' he said&mdash;'why can't you tell it
here as well as anywhere?'</p>

<p>"'Because it has to be acted,' I said, 'and
my hands are tied.'</p>

<p>"'Will you tell it if I untie your hands?'
said Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"'Well,' I said, 'I'll begin it, and you
can see how it goes.'</p>

<p>"So Mr. Dog came over and untied my
hands, for he said he could tie them again before
Mr. Man came back, because he knew
Mr. Man hadn't found that hammer yet.</p>

<p>"'You can't get loose with just your hands
untied, can you?' he said.</p>

<p>"'No, of course not, Mr. Dog,' I said,
pleasant and polite as could be.</p>

<p>"'Let's see you try,' said Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"So I twisted and pulled, and of course
I couldn't get loose.</p>

<p>"'Now tell the story,' said Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"So I said: 'Once there was a man who
had a very bad pain in his chest, and he
took all kinds of medicine, and it didn't
do him any good. And one day the Old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Wise Man of the Woods told him if he would
rub his chest with one hand and pat his
head with the other, it might draw the pain
out of the top and cure him. So the man
with the pain in his chest tried it, and he
did it this way.'</p>

<p>"Then I showed Mr. Dog just how he
did it, and Mr. Dog thought that was funny,
and laughed a good deal.</p>

<p>"'Go on and tell the rest of it,' he said.
'What happened after that?'</p>

<p>"But I let on as if I'd just remembered
something, and I said, 'Oh, Mr. Dog, I'm
<i>so</i> sorry, but I can't tell the rest of that
story here, and it's the funniest part, too.
I know you'd laugh till you rolled over the
edge of the world.'</p>

<p>"'Why can't you tell the rest of that story
here as well as anywhere?' said Mr. Dog,
looking anxious.</p>

<p>"'Because it has to be acted with the
feet,' I said, 'and my feet are tied.'</p>

<p>"'Will you tell it if I untie your feet?'
said Mr. Dog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well, I'll do the best I can,' I said.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Dog came over and untied my
feet. He said he knew that Mr. Man hadn't
found the nails or the pieces to make the
box yet, and there would be plenty of time
to tie me again before Mr. Man got back.</p>

<p>"'You can't get loose, anyway, with just
your hands and feet untied, can you?' he said.</p>

<p>"'No, of course not, Mr. Dog,' I said,
more pleasant and polite than ever.</p>

<p>"'Let's see you try,' said Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"So I squirmed and twisted, but of course
with a strong string around my waist and
tied behind I couldn't do anything.</p>

<p>"'Now go on with the story,' said Mr.
Dog.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 361px;">

<span class="caption">AND DID ROLL OFF THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, SURE ENOUGH</span>
</div>

<p>"'Well,' I said, 'the pain left his chest,
but it went into his back, and he had a most
terrible time, until one day the Old Wise
Man of the Woods came along and told him
that he thought he ought to know enough
by this time to rub his back where the pain
was and pat his head at the same time to
draw it out at the top. So then the man with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the pain rubbed his back and patted his
head this way,' and I showed Mr. Dog
how he did it; and I rubbed a good while
about where the knot was, and made a face
to show how the man with the pain looked,
and then I said the pain came back into
his chest again instead of being drawn out
at the top, and I changed about and rubbed
there awhile, and then I went around to my
back again, chasing that pain first one side
and then the other; and then I said that
the Old Wise Man of the Woods came along
one day and told him that he must kick
with his feet, too, if he ever wanted to get
rid of that pain, because, after all, it might
have to be kicked out at the bottom; and
when I began to kick and dance with both
feet and to rub with my hands at the same
time, Mr. Dog gave a great big laugh&mdash;the
biggest laugh I ever heard anybody give&mdash;and
fell right down and rolled over and over,
and did roll off the edge of the world, sure
enough.</p>

<p>"I heard him go clattering into a lot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
brush and blackberry bushes that are down
there, and just then I got that back knot
untied, and I stepped over and looked down
at Mr. Dog, who had lodged in a brier patch
on a shelf about ten feet below the edge,
where Mr. Man would have to get him up
with a ladder or a rope.</p>

<p>"'Do you want to hear the rest of the
story, Mr. Dog?' I said.</p>

<p>"'I'll story <i>you</i>,' he said, 'when I catch
you!'</p>

<p>"'I told you you'd laugh till you fell off
the edge of the world,' I said.</p>

</div>

<p>"'I'll make <i>you</i> laugh,' he said, 'when I
catch you!'</p>

<p>"Then I saw he was cross about something,
and I set out for home without waiting
to say good-bye to Mr. Man, for I didn't
want to waste any more time, though I
missed my supper and got a scolding besides.</p>

<p>"But I was glad I didn't bring home a
black eye and scratched nose, and I'm more
glad than ever now that Mr. Man didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
get back in time with that box, or I might
be in a menagerie this minute instead of
sitting here smoking and telling stories and
having a good time on Christmas Day."</p>

<p>The Story Teller looks down at the Little
Lady.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Mr. 'Coon didn't get into the
menagerie, aren't you?" she says.</p>

<p>Very glad, says the Story Teller.</p>

<p>"He went lickety split home, didn't he?"</p>

<p>He did that!</p>

<p>"I like them to go lickety split better
than lickety cut, don't you?" says the Little
Lady. "They seem to go so much faster."</p>

<p>Ever so much faster, says the Story Teller.</p>

<h2>HOW MR. RABBIT LOST HIS<br />
TAIL</h2>

<h3>MR. RABBIT TELLS SOME INTERESTING FAMILY
HISTORY</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Little Lady waited until the Story
Teller had lit his pipe and sat looking
into the great open fire, where there was a
hickory log so big that it had taken the
Story Teller and the Little Lady's mother
with two pairs of ice tongs to drag it to the
hearth and get it into place. Pretty soon the
Little Lady had crept in between the Story
Teller's knees. Then in another minute she
was on one of his knees, helping him rock.
Then she said:&mdash;</div>

<p>"Did Mr. Rabbit tell his story next?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
He promised to tell about losing his tail,
you know."</p>

<p>The Story Teller took his pipe from his
mouth a moment, and sat thinking and gazing
at the big log, which perhaps reminded
him of one of the limbs of the Hollow Tree
where the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old
Black Crow lived and had their friends visit
them that long-ago snowy Christmas-time.</p>

<p>Why, yes, he said, that's so, Mr. Rabbit
<i>did</i> tell that story. When Mr. 'Coon got
through telling how he came near getting into
a menagerie, they all said that it certainly
was a very narrow escape, and Mr. 'Coon
said he shouldn't wonder if that menagerie
had to quit business, just because he wasn't
in it; and Mr. 'Possum said he thought if
anything would <i>save</i> a menagerie that would,
for it would keep them from being eaten
out of house and home.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon said that if that was
so, Mr. 'Possum had saved at least three
menageries by staying right where he was
in the Big Deep Woods. This made Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Squirrel and Mr. Robin laugh, and the rest
wondered what those two gigglers had noticed
that was funny. Then they all knocked
the ashes out of their pipes again, and walked
over to the window, and looked at the
snow banking up outside and piling up on
the bare limbs of the big trees. They said
how early it got dark this time of year,
especially on a cloudy day. And pretty soon
Mr. Crow said they had just about time for
one more story before supper, and that Mr.
Rabbit ought to tell now about how, a long
time ago, his family had lost their tails.
Mr. Rabbit didn't seem to feel very anxious
to tell it, but they told him that he had
promised, and that now was as good a time
as any, so they went back and sat down,
and Mr. Rabbit told them</p>


<h3><br />THE TRUE STORY OF THE HARE AND<br />
THE TORTOISE, AND HOW JACK<br />
RABBIT LOST HIS TAIL</h3>

<p>"Once upon a time," he said, "a great
many great-grandfathers back, my family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had long bushy tails, like Mr. Squirrel and
Mr. Fox, only a good deal longer and finer
and softer, and <i>very handsome</i>."</p>

<p>When Mr. Rabbit said that, Mr. Squirrel
sniffed and twitched his nose and gave his
nice bushy tail a flirt, but he didn't say
anything. Mr. Rabbit went right on.</p>

<p>"Well, there was one fine, handsome rabbit
who had the longest and plumiest tail
of any of the family, and was very proud of
it. He was my twenty-seventh great-grandfather,
and was called 'Mr. Hare.' He was
young and smart then, and thought he was
a good deal smarter than he really was,
though he was smart enough and handsome
enough to set the style for all the other rabbits,
and not much ever happened to him,
because he could beat anything running
that there was in the Big Deep Woods.</p>

<p>"That twenty-seventh great-grandfather
of mine was very proud of his running, and
used to brag that in a foot race he could beat
anything that lived between the Wide Grass
Lands and the edge of the world. He used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to talk about it to almost everybody that
came along, and one day when he met one
of the Turtle family who used to be called
'Mr. Tortoise' in those days, he stopped and
began to brag to him how fast he could run
and how nobody in the Big Deep Woods
dared to race with him.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Turtle he just smiled a little
and said: 'Oh, pshaw! You can't run very
fast. I believe I can beat you myself!'</p>

<p>"Well, that did make Grandfather Hare
laugh&mdash;and made him a little mad, too.</p>

<p>'You!' he said. 'Why, I'll give you
within ten yards of that rail fence of Mr.
Man's half a mile away, and then beat you
across it. Just travel along, and some time
this afternoon, when you get down that
way, I'll come back and let you see me go
by. But you'll have to look quick if you
see me, for I'll be going fast.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="400" height="313" alt="MR. FOX SAID HE HADN&#39;T MUCH TO DO FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND HE&#39;D ACT AS JUDGE" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. FOX SAID HE HADN&#39;T MUCH TO DO FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND HE&#39;D ACT AS JUDGE</span>
</div>

<p>"But Mr. Tortoise said he didn't want
any start at all, that he was ready to begin
the race right then; and that made Grandpaw
Hare laugh so loud that Mr. Fox heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
him as he was passing, and came over to
see what the fun was. Then he said that he
hadn't much to do for a few minutes, and
that he'd stay and act as judge. He thought
a race like that wouldn't last long; and it
didn't, though it wasn't at all the kind of a
race he had expected.</p>

<p>"Well, he put Mr. Tortoise and my twenty-seventh
great-grandfather side by side,
and then he stood off and said, 'Go!' and
thought it would all be over in a minute.</p>

<p>"Grandpaw Hare gave one great big leap,
about twenty feet long, and then stopped.
He was in no hurry, and he wanted to have
some fun with Mr. Tortoise. He looked
around to where Mr. Tortoise was coming
straddling and panting along, and he laughed
and rolled over to see how solemn he looked,
and how he was travelling as if he meant
to get somewhere before dark. He was down
on all fours so he could use all his legs at
once, and anybody would think, to look at
him, that he really expected to win that race.</p>

<p>"The more my Grandpaw Hare looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
at him the more he laughed, and then he
would make another long leap forward and
stop, and look back, and wait for Mr. Tortoise
to catch up again.</p>

<p>"Then he would call to him, or maybe go
back and take roundin's on him, and say:
'Come along there, old tobacco box. Are
you tied to something?' Mr. Fox would
laugh a good deal, too, and he told my ancestor
to go on and finish the race&mdash;that he
couldn't wait around there all day. And
pretty soon he said if they were going to
fool along like that, he'd just go down to the
fence and take a nap till they got there; and
for Grandpaw Rabbit to call to him when
he really started to come, so he could wake
up and judge the finish.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fox he loped away to the fence and
laid down and went to sleep in the shade,
and Grandpaw Hare thought it would be fun
to pretend to be asleep, too. I've heard a
story told about it that says that he really
did go to sleep, and that Mr. Tortoise went
by him and got to the fence before he woke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
up. But that is not the way it happened.
My twenty-seventh great-grandfather was
too smart to go to sleep, and even if he had
gone to sleep, Mr. Tortoise made enough
noise pawing and scratching along through
the grass and gravel to wake up forty of our
family.</p>

<p>"My ancestor would wait until he came
grinding along and was up even with him,
then suddenly he'd sit up as if he'd been
waked out of a nice dream and say: 'Hello,
old coffee mill! What do you want to wake
me up for when I'm trying to get a nap?'
Then he would laugh a big laugh and make
another leap, and lie down and pretend
again, with his fine plumy tail very handsome
in the sun.</p>

<p>"But Grandpaw Hare carried the joke a
little too far. He kept letting Mr. Tortoise
get up a little closer and closer every time,
until Mr. Tortoise would almost step on
him before he would move. And that was
just what Mr. Tortoise wanted, for about
the next time he came along he came right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
up behind my ancestor, but instead of stepping
on him, he gave his head a quick snap,
just as if he were catching fish, and grabbed
my Grandpaw Hare by that beautiful plumy
tail, and held on, and pinched, and my ancestor
gave a squeal and a holler and set
out for that rail fence, telling his troubles
as he came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="500" height="297" alt="SAILING ALONG, JUST TOUCHING THE HIGHEST POINTS" title="" />
<span class="caption">SAILING ALONG, JUST TOUCHING THE HIGHEST POINTS</span>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Fox had gone sound asleep and
didn't hear the rumpus at first, and when
he did he thought Grandpaw was just calling
to him to wake up and be ready to
judge the race, so he sat up quick and
watched them come. He saw my twenty-seventh
great-grandfather sailing along, just
touching the highest points, with something
that looked like an old rusty washpan tied
to his tail.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Fox saw what it was, he just
laid down and laughed and rolled over, and
then hopped up on the top rail and called
out, 'All right, I'm awake, Mr. Hare! Come
right along, Mr. Hare. You'll beat him yet!'</p>

<p>"Then he saw my ancestor stop and shake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
himself, and paw, and roll over, to try to
get Mr. Tortoise loose, which of course he
couldn't do, for, as we all know, whenever
any of the Turtle family get a grip they
never let go till it thunders, and this was a
bright day. So pretty soon Grandpaw was
up and running again, with Mr. Tortoise sailing
out behind and Mr. Fox laughing to see
them come, and calling out: 'Come right
along, Mr. Hare! Come right along! You'll
beat him yet!'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="388" height="450" alt="AWAY WENT MR. TORTOISE, CLEAR OVER THE TOP RAIL" title="" />
<span class="caption">AWAY WENT MR. TORTOISE, CLEAR OVER THE TOP RAIL</span>
</div>

<p>"But Mr. Fox made a mistake about that.
Grandpaw Hare was really ahead, of course,
when he came down the homestretch, but
when he got pretty close to the fence he
made one more try to get Mr. Tortoise loose,
and gave himself and his tail a great big
swing, and Mr. Tortoise didn't let go quite
quick enough, and off came my twenty-seventh
great-grandfather's beautiful plumy
tail, and away went Mr. Tortoise with it,
clear over the top rail of the fence, and
landed in a brier patch on the other side.</p>

<p>"Well, Grandpaw Hare was in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
state as you never heard of! He forgot all
about the race at first, and just raved about
his great loss, and borrowed Mr. Fox's
handkerchief to tie up what was left, and
said that he never in the world could show
his face before folks again.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Fox stopped laughing as soon
as he could, and was really quite sorry for
him, and even Mr. Tortoise looked through
the fence, and asked him if he didn't think
it could be spliced and be almost as good as
ever.</p>

<p>"He said he hadn't meant to commit any
injury, and that he hoped Mr. Hare would
live to forgive him, and that now there was
no reason why my grandpaw shouldn't beat
him in the next race.</p>

<p>"Then my ancestor remembered about the
race and forgot his other loss for a minute,
and declared that Mr. Tortoise didn't win
the race at all&mdash;that he couldn't have covered
that much ground in a half a day alone,
and he asked Mr. Fox if he was going to let
that great straddle bug ruin his reputation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for speed and make him the laughing stock
of the Big Deep Woods, besides all the other
damage he had done.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Fox scratched his head, and
thought about it, and said he didn't see
how he could help giving the race to Mr.
Tortoise, for it was to be the first one across
the fence, and that Mr. Tortoise was certainly
the first one across, and that he'd
gone over the top rail in style.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="400" height="354" alt="SET OUT FOR HOME BY A BACK WAY" title="" />
<span class="caption">SET OUT FOR HOME BY A BACK WAY</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, that made Grandpaw Hare madder
than ever. He didn't say another word,
but just picked up his property that Mr.
Tortoise handed him through the fence, and
set out for home by a back way, studying
what he ought to do to keep everybody from
laughing at him, and thinking that if he
didn't do something he'd have to leave the
country or drown himself, for he had always
been so proud that if people laughed at him
he knew he could never show his face again.</p>

<p>"And that," said Mr. Rabbit, "is the true
story of that old race between the Hare
and the Tortoise, and of how the first Rabbit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
came to lose his tail. I've never told it
before, and none of my family ever did; but
so many stories have been told about the
way those things happened that we might
just as well have this one, which is the only
true one so far as I know."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Rabbit lit his pipe and leaned
back and smoked. Mr. Dog said it was a
fine story, and he wished he could have seen
that race, and Mr. Turtle looked as if he
wanted to say something, and did open his
mouth to say it, but Mr. Crow spoke up, and
asked what happened after that to Mr. Rabbit's
twenty-seventh great-grandfather, and
how it was that the rest of the Rabbits had
short tails, too.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Rabbit said that that was another
story, and Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Robin
wanted him to tell it right away, but Mr.
Crow said they'd better have supper now,
and Mr. 'Possum thought that was a good
plan, and Mr. 'Coon, too, and then they all
hurried around to get up some sticks of wood
from down stairs, and to set the table, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
everybody helped, so they could get through
early and have a nice long evening.</p>

<p>And all the time the snow was coming
down outside and piling higher and higher,
and it was getting too dark to see much when
they tried to look out the window through
the gloom of the Big Deep Woods.</p>

<h2>HOW THE OTHER RABBITS<br />
LOST THEIR TAILS</h2>

<h3>MR. JACK RABBIT CONTINUES HIS FAMILY
HISTORY</h3>


<div class='cap'>"DID they have enough left for supper&mdash;enough
for all the visitors, I mean?"
asks the Little Lady the next evening, when
the Story Teller is ready to go on with the
history of the Hollow Tree.</div>

<p>Oh, yes, they had plenty for supper, and
more, too. They had been getting ready a
good while for just such a time as this, and
had carried in a lot of food, and they had a
good many nice things down in the store
room where the wood was, but they didn't
need those yet. They just put on what they
had left from their big dinner, and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Crow stirred up a pan of hot biscuits by his
best receipt, and they passed them back
and forth across the table so much that Mr.
'Possum said they went like hot cakes, sure
enough, and always took two when they
came his way.</p>

<p>And they talked a good deal about the
stories that Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Rabbit had
told them, and everybody thought how sly
and smart Mr. 'Coon had been to fool Mr.
Dog that way; and Mr. 'Coon said that,
now he came to think it over, he supposed
it was a pretty good trick, though it really
hadn't seemed so specially great to him
at the time. He said he didn't think it half
as smart as Mr. Tortoise's trick on Mr. Rabbit's
Grandpaw Hare, when he beat him
in the foot race and went over the fence first,
taking Mr. Hare's tail with him. And then
they wondered if that had all really happened
as Mr. Rabbit had told it&mdash;all but
Mr. Turtle, who just sat and smiled to himself
and didn't say anything at all, except
"Please pass the biscuits," now and then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
when he saw the plate being set down in
front of Mr. 'Possum.</p>

<p>Then by and by they all got through and
hurried up and cleared off the table, and lit
their pipes, and went back to the fire, and
pretty soon Jack Rabbit began to tell</p>


<h3><br />HOW THE REST OF THE RABBITS<br />
LOST THEIR TAILS</h3>

<p>"Well," he said, "my twenty-seventh
great-grandfather Hare didn't go out again
for several days. He put up a sign that said
'Not at Home' on his door, and then tried
a few experiments, to see what could be
done.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="400" height="365" alt="HE TRIED TO SPLICE HIS PROPERTY BACK IN PLACE" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE TRIED TO SPLICE HIS PROPERTY BACK IN PLACE</span>
</div>

<p>"He first tried to splice his property back
into place, as Mr. Tortoise had told him he
might, but that plan didn't work worth a
cent. He never could get it spliced on
straight, and if he did get it about right, it
would lop over or sag down or something as
soon as he moved, and when he looked at
himself in the glass he made up his mind
that he'd rather do without his nice plumy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
brush altogether than to go out into society
with it in that condition.</p>

<p>"So he gave it up and put on some nice
all-healing-ointment, and before long what
there was left of it was well, and a nice
bunch of soft, white cottony fur had grown
out over the scar, and Grandpaw Hare
thought when he looked at himself in the
glass that it was really quite becoming,
though he knew the rest of his family would
always be saying things about it, and besides
they would laugh at him for letting
Mr. Tortoise beat him in a foot race.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="350" height="425" alt="GRANDFATHER WOULD LIGHT HIS PIPE AND THINK IT OVER" title="" />
<span class="caption">GRANDFATHER WOULD LIGHT HIS PIPE AND THINK IT OVER</span>
</div>

<p>"Sometimes, when there was nobody
around, my grandfather would go out into
the sun and light his pipe and lean up against
a big stone, or maybe a stump, and think it
over.</p>

<p>"And one morning, as he sat there thinking,
he made up his mind what he would
do. Mr. Lion lived in the Big Deep Woods
in those days, and he was King. Whenever
anything happened among the Deep Woods
People that they couldn't decide for themselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
they went to where King Lion lived,
in a house all by himself over by the Big
West Hills, and he used to settle the question;
and sometimes, when somebody that
wasn't very old, and maybe was plump and
tender, had done something that wasn't just
right, King Lion would look at him and
growl and say it was too bad for any one so
young to do such things, and especially for
them to grow up and keep on doing them;
so he would have him for breakfast, or maybe
for dinner, and that would settle everything
in the easiest and shortest way.</p>

<p>"Of course Grandfather Hare knew very
well that Mr. Tortoise and Mr. Fox wouldn't
go with him to King Lion, for they would
be afraid to, after what they had done, so
he made up his mind to go alone and tell
him the whole story, because he was as
sure as anything that King Lion would decide
that he had really won the race, and
would be his friend, which would make all
the other Deep Woods People jealous and
proud of him again, and perhaps make them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wish they had nice bunches of white cottony
fur in the place of long dragging tails that
were always in the way.</p>

<p>"And then some day he would show King
Lion where Mr. Fox and Mr. Tortoise lived.</p>

<p>"My Grandfather Hare didn't stop a minute
after he thought of that, but just set
out for King Lion's house over at the foot
of the Big West Hills. He had to pass by
Mr. Fox's house, and Mr. Fox called to him,
but Grandpaw Hare just set up his ears as
proud as could be and went by, lickety split,
without looking at Mr. Fox at all.</p>

<p>"It was a good way to King Lion's house,
but Grandpaw Hare didn't waste any time,
and he was there almost before he knew it.</p>

<p>"When he got to King Lion's door he
hammered on the knocker, and when nobody
came right away he thought maybe the
King was out for a walk. But that wasn't
so. King Lion had been sick for two or three
days, and he was still in bed, and had to
get up and get something around him before
he could let Grandpaw in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandpaw Hare had sat down on the
steps to wait, when all at once the door
opened behind him and he felt something
grab him by the collar and swing him in
and set him down hard on a seat, and then
he saw it was King Lion, and he didn't
much like his looks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="&quot;GLAD TO SEE YOU,&quot; SAID KING LION; &quot;I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HAVING A RABBIT FOR BREAKFAST&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;GLAD TO SEE YOU,&quot; SAID KING LION; &quot;I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HAVING A RABBIT FOR BREAKFAST&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'So it was you, was it, making that
noise?' he said. 'Well, I'm glad to see you,
for I was just thinking about having a nice
rabbit for breakfast.'</p>

<p>"Then my twenty-seventh great-grandfather
knew he'd made a mistake, coming to
see King Lion when he was feeling that way,
and he had to think pretty quick to know
what to say. But our family have always
been pretty quick in their thoughts, and
Grandpaw Hare spoke right up as polite as
could be, and said he would do anything he
could to find a nice young plump rabbit for
King Lion, and that he would even be proud
to be a king's breakfast himself, only he
wasn't so very young nor so very plump, and,
besides, there was that old prophecy about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the king and the cotton-tailed rabbit, which
of course, he said, King Lion must have
heard about.</p>

<p>"Then King Lion said that my twenty-seventh
great-grandfather was plenty young
enough and plenty plump enough, and that
he'd never heard of any prophecy about a
cotton-tailed rabbit, and that he'd never
heard of a cotton-tailed rabbit, either.</p>

<p>"Then Grandpaw Hare just got up and
turned around, and as he turned he said,
as solemnly as he could:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'When the King eats a hare with a cotton tail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then the King's good health will fail.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Well, that scared the King a good deal,
for he was just getting over one sick spell,
and he was afraid if he had another right
away he'd die, sure. He sat down and asked
Grandpaw Hare to tell him how he came to
have a tail like that, and Grandpaw told him,
and it made the King laugh and laugh,
until he got well, and he said it was the best
joke he ever heard of, and that he'd have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
given some of the best ornaments off of his
crown to have seen that race.</p>

<p>"And the better King Lion felt the hungrier
he got, and when my Grandfather Hare
asked him if he wouldn't decide the race
in his favor, he just glared at him and said
if he didn't get out of there and hunt him
up a nice, young, plump, long-tailed rabbit,
he'd eat him&mdash;cotton tail, prophecy, and
all&mdash;for he didn't go much on prophecies,
anyway.</p>

<p>"Then Grandpaw Hare got right up and
said, 'Good day,' and backed out and made
tracks for the rest of his family, and told
them that King Lion had just got up from
a sick spell that had given him an appetite
for long-tailed rabbits. He said that the
King had sent him out to get one, and that
King Lion would most likely be along himself
pretty soon. He said the sooner the
Rabbit family took pattern after the new
cotton-tailed style the more apt they'd be
to live to a green old age and have descendants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that was a busy day in the Big
Deep Woods. The Rabbit family got in line
by a big smooth stump that they picked out
for the purpose, and Grandpaw borrowed a
hatchet and attended to the job for them,
and called out 'Next!' as they marched by.
He didn't have to wait, either, for they didn't
know what minute King Lion might come.
Mr. Tortoise and Mr. Fox came along and
stopped to see the job, and helped Grandpaw
now and then when his arm got tired, and by
evening there was a pile of tails by that
stump as big as King Lion's house, and there
never was such a call for the all-healing-ointment
as there was that night in the Big Deep
Woods.</p>

<p>"And none of our family ever did have
tails after that, for they never would grow
any more, and all the little new rabbits just
had bunches of cotton, too, and that has
never changed to this day."</p>

<p>"And when King Lion heard how he'd
been fooled by Grandpaw Hare with that
foolish prophecy that he just made up right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
there, out of his head, he knew that everybody
would laugh at him as much as he had
laughed at Mr. Hare, and he moved out of
the country and never came back, and there's
never been a king in the Big Deep Woods
since, so my twenty-seventh great-grandfather
did some good, after all.</p>

<p>"And that," said Mr. Rabbit, "is the
whole story of the Hare and the Tortoise
and how the Rabbit family lost their tails.
It's never been told outside of our family
before, but it's true, for it's been handed
down, word for word, and if Mr. Fox or
Mr. Tortoise were alive now they would
say so."</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit filled his pipe and lit it, and
Mr. Crow was just about to make some
remarks when Mr. Turtle cleared his throat
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The story that Mr. Rabbit has been
telling is all true, every word of it&mdash;I was
there."</p>

<p>Then all the Deep Woods People took
their pipes out of their mouths and just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
looked at Mr. Turtle with their mouths wide
open, and when they could say anything
at all, they said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>You were there!</i>"</p>

<p>You see, they could never get used to the
notion of Mr. Turtle's being so old&mdash;as old
as their twenty-seventh great-grandfathers
would have been, if they had lived.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Turtle, "and it all comes
back to me as plain as day. It happened
two hundred and fifty-eight years ago last
June. They used to call us the Tortoise
family then, and I was a young fellow of
sixty-seven and fond of a joke. But I was
surprised when I went sailing over that
fence, and I didn't mean to carry off Mr.
Hare's tail. Dear me, how time passes!
I'm three hundred and twenty-five now,
though I don't feel it."</p>

<p>Then they all looked at Mr. Turtle again,
for though they believed he was old, and
might possibly have been there, they thought
it pretty strange that he could be the very
Mr. Tortoise who had won the race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum said, pretty soon, that when
anybody said a thing like that, there ought
to be some way to prove it.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle got up and began taking
off his coat, and all the others began to get
out of the way, for they didn't know what
was going to happen to Mr. 'Possum, and
they wanted to be safe; and Mr. 'Possum
rolled under the table, and said that he
didn't mean anything&mdash;that he loved Mr.
Turtle, and that Mr. Turtle hadn't understood
the way he meant it at all.</p>

<p>But Mr. Turtle wasn't the least bit mad.
He just laid off his coat, quietly, and unbuttoned
his shirt collar, and told Mr. 'Coon
and Mr. Crow to look on the back of his
shell.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Dog held a candle, and they
all looked, one after another, and there, sure
enough, carved right in Mr. Turtle's shell,
were the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>"That," said Mr. Turtle, "was my greatest
joke, and I had it carved on my shell."</p>

<p>And all the rest of the forest people said
that a thing like that was worth carving on
anybody's shell that had one, and when Mr.
Turtle put on his coat they gave him the
best seat by the fire, and sat and looked
at him and asked questions about it, and
finally all went to sleep in their chairs, while
the fire burned low and the soft snow was
banking up deeper and deeper, outside, in
the dark.</p>
